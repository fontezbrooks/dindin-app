# DinDin Development Memory Points
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-28
**Context**: Card Swiping Feature Development

## 🎯 Project Context Memory

### Core Mission
Replace static card images with dynamic recipe data integration in DinDin's swiping interface.

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Hono + Bun (high-performance API)
- **Frontend**: React Native + Reanimated 2 + Gesture Handler
- **Data**: 113 recipes in JSON format, production-ready
- **State**: Zustand for global card management

### Current Branch Status
- **Active Branch**: `feature/replace-static-card-images-with-recipe-images`
- **Base Branch**: `main`
- **Status**: Analysis complete, ready for implementation

## 🏗️ Architecture Understanding

### Card Swiping System (CRITICAL)
```
SwipeCards.tsx (container)
├── SwipeableCard.tsx (gesture logic)
├── useSwipeControls.js (physics engine)
└── Card.tsx (static display)
```

**Physics Engine**: Velocity threshold ±1500 for swipe decisions
**Animation**: 60fps native driver with Reanimated 2 shared values
**State Flow**: Zustand → Card Stack → Individual Cards → Gestures

### Backend API Architecture (TO IMPLEMENT)
```
/api/recipes
├── GET /?page=1&limit=10&category=breakfast
├── Image serving strategy needed
└── Error handling + validation required
```

## 📊 Data Analysis Results

### Recipe Dataset Quality
- **Volume**: 113 recipes, comprehensive nutrition data
- **Readiness**: 8/10 - production ready with minor normalization
- **Issues**: Case inconsistencies in categories/difficulty
- **Images**: Placeholder URLs present, real image strategy needed

### Data Normalization Tasks
```typescript
// REQUIRED: Standardize these inconsistencies
category: "Breakfast" | "breakfast" → Category enum
difficulty: "Easy" | "easy" → Difficulty enum
cuisine: Mixed capitalization → Standardized format
```

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap

### Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2) - IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
1. **API Development**:
   - Create Hono `/api/recipes` endpoint
   - Add pagination, filtering, error handling
   - Replace mockRecipes with real API calls

2. **Data Integration**:
   - Normalize recipe data format
   - Create TypeScript interfaces
   - Add loading states to cards

### Sprint 2-4 (Weeks 3-8)
- Image serving and caching system
- Enhanced gesture controls
- Performance optimization
- Testing and deployment

## 🔧 Critical Code Locations

### Files Requiring Immediate Changes
```
/apps/backend/src/routes/recipes.ts - CREATE API endpoint
/apps/mobile/src/components/SwipeCards.tsx - Replace mockRecipes
/packages/db/dindin-app.recipes.json - Normalize data format
/apps/backend/src/types/index.ts - Add Recipe interfaces
```

### Files Analyzed (Don't Re-analyze)
- SwipeCards.tsx - Architecture understood
- SwipeableCard.tsx - Gesture system mapped
- useSwipeControls.js - Physics engine documented
- dindin-app.recipes.json - Data quality assessed

## ⚠️ Known Constraints & Decisions

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain 60fps animation performance
- Bun preferred over Node.js (project convention)
- React Native Reanimated 2 (not upgrading to v3)
- Zustand for state (not Redux)

### Design Decisions Made
- Velocity-based swipe threshold: ±1500
- Card preloading for performance
- Fallback images for missing recipe photos
- Infinite scroll implementation required

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Image loading: Progressive enhancement with fallbacks
- API errors: Graceful degradation to cached data
- Performance: Card virtualization for large datasets
- User experience: Loading skeletons and error states

## 📝 Documentation Created

### Session Artifacts
- `agile-card-swipe-implementation-workflow.md` - Complete 8-week plan
- `session-summary-2025-10-28.md` - Detailed analysis results
- `memory-points-dindin-development.md` - This memory document

### Ready for Handoff
All analysis complete. Implementation can begin immediately with Sprint 1 tasks.

## 🎯 Next Session Preparation

### Context Loading Commands
```bash
# Check current branch status
git status && git branch

# Review implementation plan
read claudedocs/agile-card-swipe-implementation-workflow.md

# Start with Sprint 1 API development
cd apps/backend && bun dev
```

### First Implementation Task
Create `/api/recipes` endpoint in Hono backend with:
- Recipe fetching with pagination
- Category/difficulty filtering
- Proper error handling and validation
- TypeScript interface definitions

### Success Criteria for Next Session
- API endpoint functional and tested
- Frontend consuming real recipe data
- Static mockRecipes completely replaced
- Loading states implemented
