**Documentation can start in Phase 1**

| Task ID | Title | Assignee | Priority |
|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| task-18 | [P6-Compliance] Implement GDPR Export/Delete | Backend Dev | MEDIUM |

---

## Parallel Execution Strategy

### Week 1
```
Track 1 (Backend Dev): Security Fixes (task-7, 8, 9, 10)
Track 2 (Frontend Dev): Can assist with security or prep error boundaries
Track 3 (DevOps/QA): Begin GDPR documentation prep
```

### Week 2
```
Track 1 (Backend Dev): Complete security, start logging (task-12)
Track 2 (Frontend Dev): Error boundaries (task-11), test setup (task-13)
Track 3 (DevOps): CI/CD pipeline setup (task-17)
```

### Week 3-4
```
Track 1 (Backend Dev): Redis caching (task-15), service layer
Track 2 (Frontend Dev): Zustand implementation (task-14)
Track 3 (QA): Write critical path tests
```

### Week 5-6
```
Track 1 (Backend Dev): GDPR compliance (task-18)
Track 2 (Frontend Dev): Performance optimization (task-16)
Track 3 (DevOps): Monitoring and deployment prep
```

## Key Implementation Notes

### All Tasks Include:
1. **Code Snippets**: Ready-to-use implementation code
2. **Agent Recommendations**: Specific sub-agents to use (security-expert, backend-architect, etc.)
3. **Dependencies**: Clearly marked blocking dependencies
4. **Parallel Tracks**: Tagged for concurrent execution
5. **Testing Requirements**: Verification steps included

### Success Criteria:
- Phase 1 completion unblocks all other work
- Parallel tracks maximize efficiency
- Each task is self-contained for handoff
- Code examples minimize friction
- Agent assistance accelerates implementation

## Resource Allocation Summary

| Week | Backend Dev | Frontend Dev | DevOps | QA |
|------|------------|--------------|--------|-----|
| 1 | Security (10h) | Assist/Prep | Doc prep | Planning |
| 2 | Logging, WebSocket | Error boundaries | CI/CD | Test setup |
| 3 | Service layer, Redis | Zustand | Redis assist | Test writing |
| 4 | Caching, pagination | Performance prep | - | Integration tests |
| 5 | GDPR compliance | Performance | Monitoring | Load testing |
| 6 | API versioning | Final optimization | Deployment | Acceptance |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**: Backend Dev starts task-7 (Remove hardcoded IP)
2. **Parallel Start**: Frontend Dev can begin error boundary design
3. **DevOps Prep**: Start setting up Redis and monitoring infrastructure
4. **QA Planning**: Design test strategy for critical paths

Each task in Backlog.md contains:
- Complete implementation code
- Specific file paths to modify
- Testing instructions
- Agent assistance recommendations
- Clear acceptance criteria

The team can pick up any task and execute with minimal friction.
