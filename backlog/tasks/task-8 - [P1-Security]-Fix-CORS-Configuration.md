## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
CRITICAL SECURITY: Configure CORS properly to prevent CSRF attacks. Currently allows all origins (\*) which is a major security vulnerability.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 CORS configured with specific allowed origins
- [ ] #2 Environment variable ALLOWED_ORIGINS implemented
- [ ] #3 Credentials and methods properly configured
- [ ] #4 Tested with frontend origins
- [ ] #5 No wildcard (\*) origins in production
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Fixed CORS configuration by replacing wildcard CORS with proper origin validation from environment variables. Implemented dynamic origin checking that supports both configured allowed origins and development localhost access. Added credentials support for authenticated requests.
