## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks. Configure limits per endpoint based on criticality.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Rate limiter implemented using rate-limiter-flexible
- [ ] #2 100 requests per minute limit configured
- [ ] #3 Custom limits for auth endpoints
- [ ] #4 429 status code returned when limit exceeded
- [ ] #5 Rate limit headers included in responses
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implemented dual-layer rate limiting with Redis as primary and in-memory fallback. Created enhancedRateLimitMiddleware that automatically switches to in-memory rate limiting when Redis is unavailable, preventing DoS attacks even during cache failures. Added proper cleanup on shutdown.
