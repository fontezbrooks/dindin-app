‚è∫ üìä Recipe Data Analysis Report

üìÅ File Overview

- File: packages/db/dindin-app.recipes.json
- Size: 558KB (~19,351 lines)
- Records: 113 recipes
- Schema: Validated against schema-dindin-app-recipes-standardJSON.json

üèóÔ∏è Data Structure

Core Fields

Each recipe contains:

- Identification: \_id (MongoDB ObjectId), \_\_v (version)
- Basic Info: title, description, image_url
- Time: prep_time, cook_time, total_time (optional)
- Classification: difficulty, cuisine[], cuisine_type, dietary_tags[]
- Content: ingredients[], instructions[], tags[]
- Nutrition: Complete macro breakdown (calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, sugar)
- Metadata: servings, isActive, likes, import_metadata

Nested Structures

- Ingredients: Each has name, amount, unit, and \_id
- Instructions: Step-by-step with step number and description
- Import Metadata: Tracks source URL, scraper info, confidence score, extraction date

üìà Data Quality Assessment

‚úÖ Strengths

1. Complete Core Data: All recipes have required fields
2. Rich Nutrition Info: 100% have nutrition data
3. High-Quality Images: All recipes include image URLs
4. Detailed Instructions: Multi-step instructions with clear ordering
5. Source Attribution: Metadata tracks original sources (pinchofyum.com, budgetbytes.com)

‚ö†Ô∏è Issues & Inconsistencies

1. Case Inconsistency (High Priority)

- Difficulty: "easy" (78) vs "Easy" (16), "medium" (15) vs "Medium" (4)
- Dietary tags: "vegetarian" vs "Vegetarian", "gluten-free" vs "Gluten-Free"
- Cuisine types: "Main Course" vs "main course"

2. Data Quality Issues (Medium Priority)

- Ingredient names include measurements: "cup packed parsley", "teaspoon salt"
- Mixed unit formats in ingredient amounts: "1/2", "¬Ω", "2"
- 20 recipes tagged with "none" for dietary tags (should be empty array)

3. Missing Optional Fields (Low Priority)

- total_time field is optional but could be computed from prep + cook time
- No recipe ratings or review counts despite having likes field

üéØ Integration Considerations

For Card Swiping Feature

Advantages:

1. Ready-to-Display: Images, titles, and descriptions perfect for cards
2. Rich Metadata: Difficulty, time, and dietary tags for filtering
3. Nutritional Info: Can display calories/macros on cards
4. Sufficient Volume: 113 recipes provide good initial content

Implementation Requirements:

1. Data Normalization: Standardize case for difficulty, dietary tags, cuisine types
2. Image Optimization: External URLs need caching/CDN strategy
3. Filtering Logic: Build indices for dietary preferences, cuisine, difficulty
4. Type Definitions: Create TypeScript interfaces matching schema

Recommended TypeScript Interface

interface Recipe {
\_id: string; // Convert MongoDB ObjectId
title: string;
description: string;
imageUrl: string; // snake_case to camelCase
prepTime: number;
cookTime: number;
totalTime?: number;
difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard'; // Normalized
cuisine: string[];
cuisineType: string;
dietaryTags: string[]; // Normalized
nutrition: {
calories: number;
protein: number;
carbs: number;
fat: number;
fiber: number;
sugar: number;
};
servings: number;
// Simplified for card display
}

üîß Immediate Actions Required

1. Create Data Normalization Script:


    - Lowercase all difficulty values
    - Standardize dietary tags casing
    - Remove "none" dietary tags
    - Fix ingredient name/amount separation

2. Build Import Service:


    - Parse MongoDB extended JSON format
    - Convert ObjectIds to strings
    - Transform snake_case to camelCase
    - Validate against TypeScript interfaces

3. Implement Caching Strategy:


    - Cache external images locally
    - Implement progressive image loading
    - Consider thumbnail generation

üìä Statistics Summary

| Metric              | Count | Percentage |
| ------------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Total Recipes       | 113   | 100%       |
| With Images         | 113   | 100%       |
| With Nutrition      | 113   | 100%       |
| Easy Difficulty     | 94    | 83.2%      |
| Medium Difficulty   | 19    | 16.8%      |
| Vegetarian Options  | 44    | 38.9%      |
| Gluten-Free Options | 39    | 34.5%      |
| Main Courses        | 36    | 31.9%      |

üöÄ Recommendations

1. Priority 1: Normalize data during import to ensure consistency
2. Priority 2: Create batch endpoint to serve 10-20 recipes at a time
3. Priority 3: Implement user preference matching algorithm
4. Priority 4: Add recipe scoring based on user swipe history
5. Priority 5: Consider adding restaurant data in same format for unified swiping

‚úÖ Conclusion

The recipe data is production-ready with minor normalization needed. The complete nutrition information and
high-quality images make it ideal for the card swiping feature. With proper data transformation and TypeScript
interfaces, this dataset can immediately replace the static images in your current implementation.
